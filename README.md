## Allegheny County's Lots to Love Project

Lots to Love is a guide for community organizations and residents who are interested in transforming vacant lots in Allegheny County into well-loved spaces. This data includes vacant lot projects that are implemented, in progress, or just an idea. Residents can log their projects through Lots to Love and vacant lot project records include address, description, partners, stage of the project, and photos. The data source for this app is the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/lots-to-love).

The R Shiny app is deployed here: https://callielambert.shinyapps.io/Lots_to_love/.
